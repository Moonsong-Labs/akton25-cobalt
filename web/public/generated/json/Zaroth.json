  "description": "In the shadowy recesses of a forgotten forest, Zaroth stood draped in a tattered cloak that whispered secrets with every gust of wind, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clinging to him like a shroud. His piercing eyes, glinting like shards of obsidian, surveyed the gathering storm, while a low, echoing chant slipped from his lips, calling forth the restless spirits that lingered in the gloom. \"Come to me,\" he beckoned, his voice a haunting melody that danced through the air, \"for the night is ripe with power and your chains shall be broken.\""
