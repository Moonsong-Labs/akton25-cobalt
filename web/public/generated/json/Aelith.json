  "description": "Aelith stood at the edge of the ancient forest, the moonlight weaving through the gnarled branches like silver threads, illuminating their striking, mismatched eyesâ€”one a deep emerald and the other a shimmering violet. \"You think fear can stop me?\" they called out, voice steady despite the rustle of unseen creatures lurking in the shadows. With a flick of their wrist, a soft glow encircled their fingertips, as if the very essence of the night had chosen them as its champion."
