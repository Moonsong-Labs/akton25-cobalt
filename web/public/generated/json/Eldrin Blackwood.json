  "description": "In the dim light of a flickering candle, Eldrin Blackwood, a necromancer with piercing gray eyes and an aura of quiet intensity, carefully traced an intricate sigil in the air, each movement a whisper of forgotten power. The scent of damp earth and lingering incense enveloped him as he summoned shadows that danced along the walls, whispering secrets of the past. “I am not here to raise the dead,” he murmured, his voice a low rumble, “but to understand them.”"
