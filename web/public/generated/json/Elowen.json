The air was thick with the scent of aged parchment and incense, as they whispered ancient incantations, summoning shadows that danced playfully along the stone walls of their hidden lair. “Do you feel it?” elowenmoonshadow asked, their voice a soft caress, “The world is shifting, and I intend to be the one who shapes it.”"}
